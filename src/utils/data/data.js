        "Education Academy was founded on the principle that learning math can be life-changing. Not only do we recognize the tangible value in a strong math background, we also believe that when math is taught well and made to be fun, it can inspire a life-long love of learning and instill the skills to do that learning well. For our co-founders, both of whom competed in TMSCA and UIL, this experience was precisely the case. Education Academy wants to support the next generation of learners as they navigate their intellectual lives, and we cherish every opportunity to do so",
        "We promise to do our best to show students the beauty we have found in math. We hope you’re interested in doing the same."
